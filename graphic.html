    <h1>Graphic Collection</h1>
    <p>Three poster designs for the church. Based on various themes, I designed these posters.<br>
      I use <strong>photoshop</strong> and <strong>illustrator</strong> to complete my ideas.
      These posters have already been printed and used for the church in the new semester.</p>

  <h2>Gender Relationship Lecture</h2>
  <p>This is a poster made for the church. The purpose of the poster is to attract Christians who have problems on dealing with marriage and girlfriends/boyfriends.<br>
  To clearly express the main idea - the gender relationship, I combined the images of a woman and a man into one person. </p>
</div>  
<div class = "textbox second">
  <h2>Emotion Control Lecture</h2>
  <p>  This is also a flyer made for the church. This poster is to show that even though we have many emotional problems, we need to know how to control them and not manipulated by bad moods.<br>
  Three different colors are used to show the change of moods; curves are to indicate the intangibility of the feelings; the women in the background indicating that it is people who are suffering from bad feelings.</p>
</div>  
<div class = "textbox third">
  <h2>Poster for Champaign Chinese Church</h2>
  <p>  To propagandize the church at the beginning of the semester, this poster was designed.<br> 
  The big cross is attractive and represents the main goal of the poster; three green blocks let people learn the relative information of the church.</p>
